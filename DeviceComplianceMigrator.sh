# This script is ONLY intended to be used by commercial Entra ID tenants. Please reach out to Jamf support for a GCC High version if needed.
# This script does the following: 
# 1: Verify the jamf management framework is ready for the migration from Conditional Access to Device Compliance
# 2: Create a LaunchAgent to call a gatherAADInfo whenever the user logs in (will run immediately if user is already logged in)
# 3: The LaunchAgent and a script it relies on are deleted after the gatherAADInfo has run
